          <h2>The Tips</h2>
          <p>The first thing you should know is that you will have to really reflect in on yourself during this process. Probably one of the hardest parts of this process is self-reflection, and really telling the college counselors in such a limited amount of words and information who you are.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>You should also know that colleges like what's called demonstrated interest - that means show your interest in college - literally, demonstrate it. Go to interviews, go to college presentations for their college. Visit the campus, schedule a tour, talk to admissions reps, the list goes on!.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Choose the right extracurricular activities- don't just do all of them, do the ones that interest you the most and that apply to your major the most. For example, engineering students should not do a US History summer camp - they should do a engineering summer camp, something like EPICS at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Limit the number of schools you apply to. Although it may seem like applying to 50 schools will give you the most chance, it'll also physically, emotionally, and mentally drain you. College applications take a lot out of you, and doign 50 of them isn't healthy. Limit them to somewhere near 13-14 applications, <i>maxiumum</i>.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Don't waste your senior year - spend it memorably. Take parts in spirit rallies, do things that you don't normally do, live out your senior year as best you can. Don't let college applications detract you from the high school experience.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>In addition, you'll want to make sure to send all your scores to your colleges! It's a 12-13 dollar fee per score per college. Don't do this late, colleges are NOT usually lenient about this.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Finally, start pin pointing teachers for your letters of recommendations. You'll want to find a teacher who you know well in a math or science department, as well as another one in a liberal arts department. You may want to get another one from an outside source like a robotics mentor, sports coach, or college counselor. Also, it could be smart to also get a third (or fourth) letter of rec for your specific type of major.</p>
