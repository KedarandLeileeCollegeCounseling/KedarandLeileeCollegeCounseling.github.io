        <h2>College Essays</h2>
        <p>So you're wondering how to do a really good college essay? Well, college essays are really about you as a person. These essays will not be easy- they won't be like your English class essays because rather than writing about a philosopher, a novel,
          or an article, you're writing about yourself. You have to prove to the college that they should admit you in a limited number of words.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-offset-7">

    <p>The next thing you should know about the college admissions essay portion is that essays are going to be read by an admissions officer, and, if you meet their standards, you will be brought in a summary to the colleges admissions committee. Although
      your essays may take up pages and pages, you as a person will be summarized into one page or less. It is up to you as a writer to prove to the admissions committee in a limited number of words that they should pick you over another student with
      just as good qualities as you.</p>

      <p>It would be highly recommended to start brainstorming ideas for your college essay - start thinking of out of the box ideas - even the strangest ideas may be the most fun ideas to write about and the most fun for an outside source to read.</p>

      <p> Colleges also like to see well edited versions of essays. Start thinking of your ideas and even do rough drafts of your essays after your junior year ends, during the summer, or any time before your senior year starts. Most college essay prompts
        are available months in advance.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <p> We would highly recommend to edit your essays using a cloud platform with revision history - Google Docs and Evernote are great examples of this. Use this to your advantage, and get help from parents, older siblings, relatives, or even professors
      you may know at <i> different schools </i> than the one you're applying to.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Some final notes include that college essays vary from school to school. Through the common application, you'll have a variety of essays to choose from per college. But colleges will have mandatory and non-mandatory essays. Do the ones that aren't
      mandatory too, but don't try and B.S. them in order to try and get ahead of the curve. Also, try to manage time - UC essays rarely change from year to year, and they will come out during the summer time, usually mid July. You'll have plenty of time
      to proof, edit, re-proof, and re-edit your essays before submission day rolls around! Also, some colleges don't require any essays - the California State Schools (CSU schools) are quite well known for this. In this case, they'll judge you based
      off of just your numbers - grades, g.p.a, and standardized test score. They also won't accept any letters of recommendation.</p>
